# Web-Frameworks-Project

Technologies used: PHP, PHPUnit, Twig, Silex, CSS, JSON, XML, SQL.

The aim of this project is to develop a data-driven PHP (Object-Oriented) website, implementing an MVC pattern by using a Twig templating and Silex controller frameworks.

This project was proposed by the graphics and gaming researchers at Institute of Technology Blanchardstown called "The Graphics and Gaming Group (GGG)" and has been developed to provide a solid base for utilization by this group.

The website lists the projects developed by the GGG, which also associates members and students involved accordingly.

The scope of this website refers to the CRUD operations performed by an administrator (with full permissions), students and supervisors (limited permissions). Students and Supervisors can be marked as "past". Students can also upload and change their profile page photo.

The project is tested with PHPUnit framework, and it applies the PHPDocumentor to provide more details about the functionality of this website.

For security reasons, all passwords stored in database are hashed and cannot be decrypted. 

The file with users' logins stores registered users credentials, but this is only for the learning purpose.
